  <h2> My Relationship with One Directions Music:</h2>

  <body bgcolor = ff0000>

  When One Direction first came out I was only about nine and already part of the wave of people that hated them. I would hear their songs on the radio and sing along until realizing it was One Direction and promptly shut up in disgust. But as my eight grade year rolled around I started getting really into their music opting not to give a crap about anybody elses opinions and fell in love with their music. When Zayn malik left the band and as their last year came to a close I started to listen to their music even more. As a tribute to one of the best boy bands of all time I decided to put together a few of my favorite songs from every album to share with new listeners! Have fun listening!

    <h3> More About Me!
    <h4> Currently I am an incoming junior at a small highschool on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. Although I dont have much, on my free time I like to go bike riding with my dad or simply dancing around my room with my older sister. My swim practices take up most of my time because they are sceduled more than 6 times in a week at the least. My least favorite subject is math but I really love English. My favorite TV show is Jane the Virgin and I dont have a favorite movie.
